# Cluster section defines directives related to master/slave
# All directives at this section handled by reload.
# NOTE : to change all directives at cluster, please do the followings
# 1 . put this server in single mode with changing the "master: false" then reload
# 2 . change your directives and put the "master: true" then reload again

# master (string): [true/false]
# Defines that this server has some slaves. If set "true" you have to define slaves section
# checkinterval (int):
# the interval of slaves healthcheck in milliseconds

# id (int) : defines the id of slave. Master will sync the slaves by id priority.
# ip (string) : is the IP of slave
# port (string) : is the listen port of destination IP
# authorization (string) : [true/false] defines if the destination slave uses token or not
# token (string) : in case of authorization is true, you need to define token
