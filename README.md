# Welcome to NIPO

Nipo is a powerful, fast, multi-thread, clustered and in-memory key-value database, with ability to configure token and acl on commands and key-regexes written by GO.
With several mathematical and aggregation functionalities on batch of keys and values.

**Fast**

Nipo will give you up to **15K OPS** in single mode and up to **2.5K OPS** in cluster mode with 2 slaves.

**Multi-Thread**

Nipo's architecture is multi-thread and you can define core and threads in your config file.

**Clustered**

Nipo supports several slaves and guaranties your slaves synchronization. It will automatically sync slave after comming up. You can ask your cluster status. The healthcheck interval could be configured in millisecond.

**In-Memory**

Nipo is in-memory database and data will be lost if service stops.

# Config file
## global
Global section defines some global parameters

`authorization (string): [true/false]`

Defines that the clients must work with token or not. If set "true" you have to define users section

`master (string): [true/false]`

Defines that this server has some slaves. If set "true" you have to define slaves section

`checkinterval (int):`

Defines the interval of slaves healthcheck in milliseconds

    global:  
      authorization: false
      master: true
      checkinterval: 1000



## slaves
Slave section defines parameter about slaves of this server

`id (int)` : defines the id of slave. Master will sync the slaves by id priority.

`ip (string)` : is the IP of slave

`port (string)` : is the listen port of destination IP

`authorization (string) : [true/false]` defines if the destination slave uses token or not

`token (string)` : in case of authorization is true, you need to define token


    slaves:
      - slave:
        id : 1
        ip : 127.0.0.1
        port : 2324
        authorization: false
        token: 061b30a7-1a12-4280-8e3c-6bc9a19b1683
      - slave:
        id : 2
        ip : 127.0.0.1
        port : 2325
        authorization: false
        token: 061b30a7-1a12-4280-8e3c-6bc9a19b1683


## proc
Proc section defines parameters for multi-threading and multi-processing

`cores (int)` : the count of cores you want to used by nipo

`threads (int)` : the count of threads you want to created by nipo

**NOTE** : the best practice is using threads two times of cores

    proc:
      cores: 2
      threads: 4


## listen
At this section you can configure your server side listen IP and PORT, currently only TCP is allowed.

    listen:
      ip: 0.0.0.0
      port: 2323
      protocol: tcp

## log
Log section defines parameters for logging

    level (int) :
      0 - no log
      1 - info
      2 - debug

`path (string)` : defines the path of log file

    log:
      level: 1
      path: "/tmp/nipo.log"

## users
Users section defines parameters for authorization. 
If authorization in global section is true, this section had to be defined
you can define several users

`name (string)` : just is metadata for name of user

`token (string)` : used for authorization

`keys (string)` : the regex of keys which user should have access.
                if you have several regexes you can separate them with delimiter "||"

`cmds (string)` : the list of commands that user should have access to execute
                if you have several commands you can separate them with delimiter "||"

    users:
      - user:
        name: admin
        token: 061b30a7-1a12-4280-8e3c-6bc9a19b1683
        keys: .*
        cmds: all
      - user:
        name: readonly
        token: 0517376d-49c1-40eb-a8fc-fd73b70a4ce9
        keys: name.*||.*log.*
        cmds: get||select||avg
